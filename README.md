# Workflow Tracker

## Description

• This is a simple Kanban board utilized to track the workflow of myself and other participating people within designated tasks and objectives. There are three swim lanes that are labeled: "To Do, In Progress, and Done." Each tracks task cards with there respective Title, Description and Due Date that has been assigned to them from a modal that appears on screen when the "Add Task" button is pressed. There has been color coding applied to any card that is late, due today or due tomorrow. These dates are calculated using dayJS within the existing script and index pages. IF the card is late, then its applied with a red color style. Any card that is due today or tomorrow is colored with a yellow style. All others remain in their default styling upon creation. When a card is moved between lanes the color remains until it is placed in the done coloumn. However, if the cards are moved back, the color is re-applied. In the future I would like to add the ability to have the color coding update with the dates as well. This is something that I will look into in a future project. This way if something is due tomorrow and placed into done, but has to be reworked and is moved back into in progress it can turn red if its now past its due date. This would apply for future cards, today, tomorrow, etc..
